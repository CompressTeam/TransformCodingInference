Info: Running Quartus Prime Fitter
    Info: Version 17.1.0 Build 240 10/25/2017 SJ Pro Edition
    Info: Processing started: Wed May 22 21:23:47 2019
Info: Command: quartus_fit --read_settings_files=off --write_settings_files=off Entropy_encoding -c Entropy_encoding
Info: qfit2_default_script.tcl version: #1
Info: Project  = Entropy_encoding
Info: Revision = Entropy_encoding
Info (170193): Fitter routing operations beginning
Info (170239): Router is attempting to preserve 0.00 percent of routes from an earlier compilation, a user specified Routing Constraints File, or internal routing requirements.
Info (170195): Router estimated average interconnect usage is 1% of the available device resources
    Info (170196): Router estimated peak interconnect usage is 11% of the available device resources in the region that extends from location X204_Y180 to location X215_Y191
Info (170199): The Fitter performed an Auto Fit compilation.  Optimizations were skipped to reduce compilation time.
    Info (170201): Optimizations that may affect the design's routability were skipped
    Info (170200): Optimizations that may affect the design's timing were skipped
Info (11888): Total time spent on timing analysis during Routing is 24.92 seconds.
Warning (18291): Timing characteristics of device 1SG210HN3F43E3VGS1 are preliminary
Info (16607): Fitter routing operations ending: elapsed time is 00:06:43
